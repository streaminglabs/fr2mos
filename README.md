# FR2MOS (Full Reference to MOS) conversions
## Summary
This project implements mappings between PSNR, SSIM, VMAF and other popular full-reference quality metrics and human-reported MOS scores on different types of user devices: PCs, tablets, smartphones, and TVs. Potential applications include streaming analytics, playback, and encoding optimizations tools.
